    The Briard originated in, and is named for, the Brie historic region
    of north-central France, where it was traditionally used both for 
    herding sheep and to defend them.[3][4]: 287  The first written 
    mention of the shepherd dogs of Brie is thought to be in the Cours 
    complet d'agriculture of Jean-Baptiste François Rozier,[5]: 41  
    who in 1783 wrote that the "chien de Brie" was long-haired and 
    usually black;[a] that in the open plains there was little danger 
    from wolves, and so the dogs were used more for herding than for 
    defence.
